# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I am Ardi!

I am a software engineer working with JavaScript and on all-things-web. I am currently based in Yogyakarta, Indonesia and working here as well, but I am open to remote roles across the globe.

I am [@ardizanki_](https://twitter.com/ardizanki_) on Twitter. From time to time, I tweet about things I learned in my personal journey, be it tech, career, or even just general things about life. If you are on the platform, letâ€™s connect!
